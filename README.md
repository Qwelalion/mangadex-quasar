# Mangadex Quasar

A Mangadex Frontend made in Quasar Framework app

This project is made as a learning platform for me to learn how to consume API using axios, it is not meant for production use, there are alot of missing features.

## API url Configuration

Url for API is configured using env file (.env)

```bash
BACKEND_API=https://api.mangadex.org/
```

## Install the dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

```bash
quasar dev
or
yarn dev
```

### Lint the files

```bash
yarn run lint
```

### Build the app for production

```bash
quasar build
or
yarn build
```

### Customize the configuration

See [Configuring quasar.conf.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli/quasar-conf-js).
